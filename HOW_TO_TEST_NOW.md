## 🎯 **3 Ways to Test**

### **Method 1: Click Example Buttons** (Easiest)

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. You'll see 4 example buttons
3. Click **"YEAR() Function (Non-SARGABLE)"**
4. Click **"Analyze Query"**
5. Watch results appear in 2 seconds! ✨

**What You'll See:**
- 🔴 Critical issues with cost percentages
- 📍 Exact line numbers
- ⚠️ Problem explanations
- ✅ Specific fixes
- 💾 Index recommendations
- 📈 Expected improvements

---

### **Method 2: Paste Your Real Query** (Most Impressive)

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Clear the text area
3. Paste Query A or Query B (from your email)
4. Click **"Analyze Query"**
5. See comprehensive analysis!

**Try This Query:**
```sql
SELECT
  d.descr AS donor_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gd.credit_type IN ('Hard','Soft') THEN gd.amount ELSE 0 END) AS total,
  (SELECT MAX(gd2.posted_date)
   FROM SFDC.dbo.GIVING_DETAIL gd2
   WHERE COALESCE(gd2.account, gd2.contact) = COALESCE(gd.account, gd.contact)) AS last_gift
FROM SFDC.dbo.GIVING_DETAIL gd
JOIN COGNOS_DW.dbo.DONOR_DIM d ON d.SF_ID = COALESCE(gd.account, gd.contact)
WHERE YEAR(gd.posted_date) = 2023
GROUP BY d.descr;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Detects YEAR() function (72% cost)
- Detects COALESCE() in WHERE
- Detects correlated subquery
- Provides all fixes
- Shows 95% improvement potential

### **Method 3: Test Via Command Line**

```bash
# Simple test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/bi/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SELECT * FROM table WHERE YEAR(date) = 2023"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool

# Your real Query A
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/bi/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @query_a.json \
  | python3 -m json.tool

# Get formatted text output
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/bi/analyze/formatted \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "YOUR QUERY HERE"}'
```

## ✅ **What to Look For**

### **In the UI, Check:**

1. **Summary Badges (Top Right)**
   - Should show: 🔴 X Critical, 🟡 Y Warnings

2. **Performance Card**
   - Total Issues count
   - Potential Improvement percentage
   - Estimated baseline (if available)

3. **Bottleneck Cards**
   - Each issue in its own card
   - Severity emoji (🔴🟡🔵)
   - Issue type icon
   - Line number
   - Query fragment in dark code block
   - Problem description
   - Why it's slow explanation
   - Fixes list (numbered)
   - Optimized code (green box)
   - Index SQL (blue box)
   - Expected improvement

## 🎬 **Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Show Non-SARGABLE Detection**
```
1. Click "YEAR() Function" example
2. Point out line 8 in the query
3. Click Analyze
4. Show:
   - "Line 8: YEAR(gd.posted_date) = 2023"
   - "70% of runtime"
   - Fix: "gd.posted_date >= '2023-01-01' AND ..."
   - "80-95% faster expected"
```

**Talking Point:**
> "This is the #1 issue we see in our BI queries. The tool detects it automatically and generates the SARGABLE rewrite."

---

### **Scenario 2: Show COALESCE Pattern**
```
1. Click "COALESCE() Blocking Index"
2. Explain: "In our donor data, we have account OR contact"
3. Click Analyze
4. Show the UNION ALL split fix
5. Point out: "Our team saw 11s → 0.9s with this exact fix"
```

**Talking Point:**
> "This is specific to our data model. The tool recognizes this pattern and suggests the optimization we actually use in production."

---

### **Scenario 3: Show Multiple Issues**
```
1. Paste Query A (the complex one)
2. Click Analyze
3. Show all 5 bottlenecks detected
4. Point to cost breakdown
5. Show potential 95% improvement
```

**Talking Point:**
> "For complex queries, it finds multiple issues, prioritizes by cost, and shows the cumulative improvement potential."

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

The tool is working correctly if:

✅ Frontend loads without errors
