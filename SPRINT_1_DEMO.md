# 🎯 QueryLens BI Edition - Sprint 1 Demo

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ First Detector Working!  
**Test Results:** 3/3 Passing

---

## ✨ **What's Been Built**

### **Core Components:**

1. **`ExecutionPlanNode.java`** - Represents SQL Server execution plan operators
   - Tracks cost, rows, I/O, CPU
   - Calculates cost percentage
   - Maps to query lines
   - Tree structure for plan hierarchy

2. **`Bottleneck.java`** - Represents a performance issue
   - Severity levels (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO)
   - Issue types (NON_SARGABLE, MISSING_INDEX, etc.)
   - Links to query lines
   - Provides actionable fixes
   - Includes optimized SQL

3. **`NonSargableDetector.java`** - YOUR #1 Priority Detector!
   - Detects `YEAR(date)` functions ✅
   - Detects `MONTH(date)` functions ✅
   - Detects `COALESCE(col1, col2)` ✅ (Very common in your queries!)
   - Detects `ISNULL()` functions ✅
   - Detects string functions ✅
   - Maps to execution plan costs
   - Generates SARGABLE rewrites

## 🧪 **What It Can Do Now**

### **Test 1: Detect YEAR() Function (Your Real Query)**

**Input SQL:**
```sql
SELECT
  d.descr AS donor_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN gd.credit_type IN ('Hard','Soft') THEN gd.amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_giving,
  MAX(gd.posted_date) AS last_gift_date
FROM SFDC.dbo.GIVING_DETAIL gd
JOIN COGNOS_DW.dbo.DONOR_DIM d
  ON d.SF_ID = COALESCE(gd.account, gd.contact)
WHERE gd.isdeleted = 'false'
  AND YEAR(gd.posted_date) = 2023    -- ⚠️ Problem!
GROUP BY d.descr
```

**What It Detects:**
- ✅ Line 7: `YEAR(gd.posted_date) = 2023`
- ✅ Issue: Non-SARGABLE predicate
- ✅ Impact: Prevents index seek on `posted_date`
- ✅ Cost: 72% of total runtime (if scan detected in plan)

**Generated Fix:**
```sql
-- Replace this:
WHERE YEAR(gd.posted_date) = 2023

-- With this:
WHERE gd.posted_date >= '2023-01-01' 
  AND gd.posted_date < '2024-01-01'
```

**Explanation Provided:**
> "SQL Server cannot use an index on 'posted_date' because the YEAR() function must be applied to every row before comparison. This forces a full table scan."

**Expected Improvement:**
> "~70-90% reduction in logical reads, ~80-95% faster execution for selective date ranges"

---

### **Test 2: Detect COALESCE() (Your Common Pattern)**

**Input SQL:**
```sql
WHERE COALESCE(gd.account, gd.contact) = @donor_id
```

**What It Detects:**
- ✅ Non-SARGABLE use of COALESCE
- ✅ Prevents index usage on both `account` and `contact`

**Generated Fix:**
```sql
-- Branch 1: Seek on account
WHERE account = @value
UNION ALL
-- Branch 2: Seek on contact where no account
WHERE contact = @value AND account IS NULL
```

**Why This Works:**
- Converts 1 scan into 2 index seeks
- Typically 10-20x faster!

---

### **Test 3: Multiple Issues in One Query**

**Input SQL:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM GIVING_DETAIL gd
WHERE YEAR(gd.posted_date) = 2023              -- Issue #1
  AND COALESCE(gd.account, gd.contact) = @id   -- Issue #2
```

**What It Detects:**
- ✅ Finds BOTH issues
- ✅ Separate bottleneck for each
- ✅ Individual fixes for each
- ✅ Can combine fixes in optimized query

---

## 📊 **Example Output Format**

Here's what the analysis looks like:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔴 CRITICAL #1: Non-SARGABLE Predicate (72% of runtime)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 Location: Line 7
   WHERE YEAR(gd.posted_date) = 2023

⚠️  Problem:
   Function YEAR() on column 'gd.posted_date' prevents index seek

🐌 Why It's Slow:
   SQL Server cannot use an index on 'posted_date' because the 
   YEAR() function must be applied to every row before comparison. 
   This forces a full table scan.

💰 Impact:
   • 72% of total runtime
   • 49 seconds
   • 18.2M rows scanned
   • 2.5M logical reads

✅ Fix:
   Replace YEAR() function with SARGABLE date range

   gd.posted_date >= '2023-01-01' 
   AND gd.posted_date < '2024-01-01'

💾 Recommended Index:
   CREATE INDEX IX_gd_posted_date 
   ON SFDC.dbo.GIVING_DETAIL (posted_date) 
   INCLUDE (account, contact, amount, credit_type);

📈 Expected Improvement:
   ~70-90% reduction in logical reads, 
   ~80-95% faster execution for selective date ranges
```
